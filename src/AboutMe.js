          <p>
            My name is Araz Kubtanjian. I'm a Junior Front-end Developer who's
            passionate about technology. I have an adverse educational
            background, where I've studied in the domains of science as well as
            real estate. However I was never committed to any career path until
            now. Software development has captured my heart and I'm now a
            devoted aspiring front-end developer hoping to build a career and
            improve my coding skills along the way.{" "}
